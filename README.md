# SSH-RSA-Grabber
A tool to grab the private RSA key.

# Instructions
Read the code, you will notice there is a space with a lot of recommendations, this will help you choose what option you'd like to add. Do a simple google search on how to upload the info.tar.gz to a selected website or scp/ftp/sftp etc... If you have access to root, the tool will grab the passwd and shadow files. <br />

I'm NOT responsible for bad usage.
